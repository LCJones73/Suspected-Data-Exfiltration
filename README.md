# Suspected-Data-Exfiltration-From-PIP-Employee
An employee placed on a P.I.P. has displayed behavior to suggest he may exfiltrate data and quit the company.

## 09:00 AM â€“ A Sudden Shift in Focus:<BR>
Itâ€™s a standard midweek morning at a technology firm specializing in proprietary R&D. The IT security team is wrapping up routine endpoint health checks when a message from HR changes the dayâ€™s trajectory. An employee, John Doe, working in a sensitive department, has just been placed on a _Performance Improvement Plan_ (PIP). Minutes later, John had an emotional outburst in the officeâ€”slamming his desk and leaving abruptly.

Management, concerned by Johnâ€™s access level and erratic behavior, raises a red flag: Could he be planning to steal proprietary information before quitting?

## 09:30 AM â€“ The Hunt Begins<BR>
The endpoint response team pivots immediately. Using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), they initiate a targeted investigation into John's corporate device:
First step: pull the device timeline and process activity for the last 72 hours. The team is on alert for signs of reconnaissance, unusual file access, or potential data staging.

Now that the stage is set, let's work through this scenario and see what we as the SOC Analyst discovers.

### - Preparation
> [!NOTE]
> <strong>Set up the hunt by defining what you're looking for:</strong><BR><BR>
The server team has noticed a significant network performance degradation on some of their older devices attached to the network in the 10.0.0.0/16 network. After ruling out external DDoS attacks, the security team suspects something might be going on internally.<BR><BR>
Activity: All traffic originating from within the local network is by default allowed by all hosts. There is also unrestricted use of PowerShell and other applications in the environment. Itâ€™s possible someone is either downloading large files or doing some kind of port scanning against hosts in the local network.
### - Data Collection
> [!TIP]
> <strong>Gather relevant data from logs, network traffic, and endpoints.</strong><BR><BR>
Consider inspecting the logs for excessive successful/failed connections from any devices.  If discovered, pivot and inspect those devices for any suspicious file or process events.<BR><BR>
Activity: Ensure data is available from all key sources for analysis.
Ensure the relevant tables contain recent logs:<br><br>
DeviceNetworkEvents<BR>
DeviceFileEvents<BR>
DeviceProcessEvents

### - Data Analysis
> [!TIP]
> <strong>Analyze data to test your hypothesis.</strong><BR><BR>
Activity: Look for anomalies, patterns, or indicators of compromise (IOCs) using various tools and techniques.
Anything going on that you can notice in terms of excessive network connections to/from any hosts? Take note of the the query/logs/time
### - Investigation
> [!WARNING]
> <strong>Investigate any suspicious findings.</strong><BR><BR>
Activity: Dig deeper into detected threats, determine their scope, and escalate if necessary. See if anything you find matches TTPs within the MITRE ATT&CK Framework.
Search the DeviceFileEvents and DeviceProcessEvents tables around the same time based on your findings in the DeviceNetworkEvents tables to see if you can find more evidence for the cause of network slowdowns.
### - Response
> [!WARNING]
> <strong>Mitigate any confirmed threats.</strong><BR><BR>
Activity: Work with security teams to contain, remove, and recover from the threat.
Can anything be done?
### - Documentation
> [!NOTE]
> <strong>Record your findings and learn from them.</strong><BR><BR>
Activity: Document what you found and use it to improve future hunts and defenses.
Document what you did
### - Improvement
> [!IMPORTANT]
> <strong>Improve your security posture or refine your methods for the next hunt.</strong><BR><BR>
Activity: Adjust strategies and tools based on what worked or didnâ€™t.
Anything we could have done to prevent the thing we hunted for? Any way we could have improved our hunting process?

## Notes / Findings:

### Timeline Summary and Findings:
I started with checking the DeviceFileEvents to see if John Doe was running anything that might indicate data exfiltration:

I noticed that he had run a PowerShell script meant to test to see if PowerShell scripts can be run on his maching successfully

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba1d7b7a-af63-4f77-975e-1130f06230f3)

I also noticed in the same search that John Doe also ran had an Archive.zip file for: 2025-05-14T00:46:24.5921685Z

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c17fd720-fbb9-45e5-ab68-2b9b80761823)

I know that when I see an "Archive.zip" (via DeviceProcessEvents, FileCreationEvents, or similar tables) it typically indicates that a ZIP archive was either:

ðŸ”¹ Created, Accessed, Downloaded, or Dropped

In this case John Doe was using it in relation to Microsoft 3D Viewer (look below):

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c7f4684-088e-48da-881d-a4cf963571ed)

Since that is not so suspicious, I remembered there was that one .ps1 file indicating testing to ensure the PowerShell scripts work on his device. So, I ran the following KQL code to dig deeper into what John Doe was potentially doing:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa7c9930-61e4-4f7e-a260-f81ea6ceeceb)

I discovered the following:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c898146-04ff-4312-b442-ccd729eeeb7c)

Digging a little deeper I wanted to see if any files were staged to potentially be exfiltrated:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4198241a-75b8-4f62-8dea-7cad25d5dab6)

Which yielded the following files:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0afeb915-1e60-4445-ade2-f7ada16da3b5)

This PowerShell code is simply downloading, which we might say is "infiltration" not "Exfiltration" of data.

## Why It's Not Exfiltration:
 - Invoke-WebRequest with -OutFile downloads data from a URL to the local machine.
 - No files are being read from the system and sent elsewhere â€” that would involve:
   - Invoke-RestMethod or Invoke-WebRequest with a POST
   - UploadFile(), System.Net.WebClient
   - Use of cloud storage URLs, FTP, Discord, Mega.nz, etc.

A final scan using the following KQL code to see if John Doe has exfiltrated files:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25cb5c80-5f25-4a82-8352-e810bfd10105)

The results yielded nothing, which means for now John Doe has not acted maliciously to exfiltrate data.

## 12:00 PM â€“ The Incident Summary Report finalized: 
John Doe is cleared of any suspicion for exfiltrating data, the report is finalized and sent to HR for review.<BR>
